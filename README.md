## Program Schedule Overview

**Week 1 Session 1:** The initial session of the program's first week served as an orientation, acquainting participants with the program itself, its instructor, and the schedule. This session predominantly centered on key topics, including an introduction to open-source principles and the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation). It also covered the art of selecting suitable open-source projects for contribution and the necessary prerequisites for effective participation in the open-source community.

**Week 1 Session 2:** During the second session of the first week, participants focused on acquiring knowledge about essential tools like CLOTributor for narrowing down project options that align with individual preferences. The session also delved into important concepts such as GitHub and Git basics, GitHub Actions, and expanded insights into The Linux Foundation.

**Week 2 Session 1:** In the second week of our CNCF program, we delved into the history and progress of CNCF projects, exploring what motivates individuals to contribute to open-source initiatives. Our instructor, Taylor Dolezal, left a lasting impression with his fantastic and approachable teaching style. In addition to valuable insights, he demonstrated the entire process, from forking a repository to creating a pull request (PR).

**Week 2 Session 2:** The session was centered around exploring the topics of Cloud Native Evolution and Cloud Native Trends, featuring active engagement through a question-and-answer format where the instructor either provided answers or directed participants to relevant articles and white papers. Towards the end, attendees were tasked with homework, which involved finding a project that aligned with their interests in the subject matter.

**Week 3 Session 1:** In the third week, participants were allowed to take the spotlight by presenting their screens. They were encouraged to share their involvement in various projects, showcasing their approach to addressing the issues at hand and detailing their interactions with project maintainers.

**Week 3 Session 2:** This session was primarily intended for clearing doubts and addressing any questions or uncertainties participants may have had.

**Week 4 Session 1:** The first session of the last week had the following agenda:
- Hot seat opportunity: During this segment, participants had the chance to share information about their projects, issues, or the specific focus of their pull requests, offering an opportunity for discussion and feedback.

- Live lesson: The session included a live lesson where the participants reviewed the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) website and learned how to navigate through its resources and additional learning materials.

**Week 4 Session 2:** The program has concluded, marking a moment of celebration, friendly conversations, and discussions about the future steps for all the attendees.
